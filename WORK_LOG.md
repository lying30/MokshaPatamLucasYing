| September 2nd |  8:15-8:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                     For the first 30 minutes of my first attempt, I just brainstormed ideas because I was somewhat confused where to start. I think that I will need to implement some sort of breadth first search like we did in the mazesolver problem set a while back. I think that problem set is similar due to the objective being to find the fastest route to the end of the maze. |
| September 2nd |  8:45-9:23pm  | I knew that I needed a way to access each point on the board so I made an array for the board and implemented the ladders and snakes into the board. I then looked at my MazeSolver game from 2 years ago and tried to see what I did in that code to accomplish the BFS solver. I saw I used a queue and looked through the different ways while using a array of visited cells. I made some comments on my main code but I am still a little confused on how to continue. Hopefully tomorrow's class sparks some thoughts. |

(forgot to commit this 30 min work period at the end of class) |

The array for the board is like really quick it is so efficient. |
