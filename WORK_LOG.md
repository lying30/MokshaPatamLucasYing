| September 2nd | 8:00-8:30pm |  For the first 30 minutes of my first attempt, I just brainstormed ideas because I was somewhat confused where to start. I think that I will need to implement some sort of breadth first search like we did in the mazesolver problem set a while back. I think that problem set is similar due to the objective being to find the fastest route to the end of the maze. |
